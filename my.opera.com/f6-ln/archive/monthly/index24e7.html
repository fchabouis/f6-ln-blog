<div class="content">May the 24th<br>We are now in Kentucky.<br><br>The flight from Chile to the States went well, and again no bike was damaged and no luggage was lost. <br>Helene's mother came to visit us in Mobile Alabama. for a few days we lived in luxury, eating in restaurants, sleeping in deep comfortable beds and waking up late. But we usually wake up late anyway.<br><br>We visited New Orleans, went to the Jazz Festival and had a very good time.<br><br>Then, after a week it was time to reassemble the bikes, to clean them and to leave.<br><br>First we didn't enjoy the ride too much. We had some bad T-storms and after the Chilean snow capped mountains, the landscapes we rode trough seemed a little bit too flat. Luckily, we met very nice people on the way and were invited by people to sleep near their houses very often.<br><br>And then, little by little, the road beacame more hilly and more interesting. The sun came back too, and we met 3 others cyclists. 2 South Africans and a Canadian. We have beeen riding with them for a week now. <br><br>We are now almost half way from the Canadian border, and try to keep riding at a steady pace, as we have to meet a friend in Toronto by the end of June.<br><br>A few days ago, we reached the 10 000 kilometers and were quit happy to. We put some albums with our US pictures...<br><br>Thank you to all the people who hosted in the US and who helped us.<br><br>Cheers<br><br>xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx<br><br>4/9/09<br>When Helene started this "News in English" category, I told her I was not sure we would have enough time to update it regularly. I was wrong ! We just update it every 5 months.<br><br>So what happened to us since Western Australia ?<br><br>We flew to Melbourne and then cycled to Sydney. That was very different from our previous experience in Western Australia : the roads were extremely busy and a little bit too dangerous to really enjoy the ride. Except for the first hundreds kilometers trough the Snowy Mountains and the Kosziusco National Park. I'm quite sure, the spelling is wrong. The ride was not the best but on the other hand, we met there many awesome people who invited us home. Thank you Allen, Frankie, John, Virginia, Jenny, Warwick !<br><br><br>From Sydney, we flew to Christchurch and then started to cruise on the South Island. We cycled from Picton all the way down to Balclutha (1,500 kilometers). The We(s)t Coast was really nice and little bit crowded with sandflies. Again we met nice peoples and, for the first time we cycled with other cylotourists.<br>Thank you Kerry and Gabriella for your help in Saint-Arnaud. You might be happy to know that your backpack will go back to Angelus hut, as we gave it to the Bloomfield family (thank you too !) who will certainly go hiking there very soon. <img src="../../../../static.myopera.com/community/graphics/smiley.gif" class="smiley s-wink" alt="wink"><br><br>In the South of the South Island, we started to think that the weather was a little bit wet and cold. We didn't know what was waiting for us next...in Patagonia !<br>We arrived in Punta Arenas, in the very South of Chile. We started from there because we knew we were a little bit late : the best periods are unfortunately the same in NZ and patagonia. But we were hoping that, going North, the weather would be better. Not really. Of course we had some good sunny days and the landscape are often breathtaking. But when it's raining, you can wear Goretex or whatever you like, at the end of the day you will be wet. And then you have to sleep in your tent, which is dry, but only the first day. In NZ, in 6 weeks we cycled 1500km. In patagtonia we did 850 in the same time. Not that we were lazy but it was really tough. We had the worst head wind you can imagine in Argentina, and the wetest rain in Chile.<br><br>On the 20th of April, we fly to Mobile, USA. We have to dig in our paniers to find the swimming suit and the sun scream...We will try to let you know what happen to us next before we reach Paris...or before you learn french.<br><br>Francis &amp; Helene<br><br><br><br><br><br>After travelling during three months in Europe, we are now in Australia. We arrived in Perth three weeks ago, did a little shopping and left to cycle on the Munda Biddi Mountainbike trail with our recumbents. It was really great, except for the weather, which was a little rainy.<br>Then we followed the coast to Albany, passing by Northcliffe, Walpole and Denmark. The scenery was awesome, with blue-green water and empty beaches (Green's Pool and Elephant Rocks are magic), nice inlets, ...<br>We met many travellers on the coast, mainly French speaking young guys in Australia for one year with the Holiday &amp;  Travel Visa, and australian people travelling in camping cars.<br><br><br>A few tips for cyclotourists and travellers<br><br>Cycling Europe<br>- itinerary<br>We went from Paris to Athens with our recumbents. There are no dirt roads in Western Europe and the sealed roads are all quite busy. We took the smallests we could but there were still much more cars than in Western Australia.<br>From Paris we followed the Seine and the Marne rivers, then the Canal de Bourgogne (Burgundy canal) till Pouilly-en-Auxois, then the Rhone river valley to Aix-en-Provence, Toulon and Saint Raphael. Then we basically followed the western Italian riviera (except for San Gimignano and Siena) to Naples. From Naples we crossed the Apenine mountains to the west coast and then cycled south to Barri, where we took the ferry to Patras (greek harbour). From Patras to Athens we followed the northern coast of the Peloponese (southern peninsula of Grece).<br>This itinerary was great, and we saw many beautiful cities of Italy that way. The Peloponese coast was not too hilly and we could swim all the time.<br>- cycling paths<br>We found very few cycling paths in both Italy and Grece.<br>In France, we found a few of them and we really appreciated :<br>• The canal de Bourgogne : you follow the canal, so that it is very flat. Some parts are sealed, some are not sealed yet. You come across camping places and small villages where you can buy some food. It starts in $$$  and finishes in $$$<br>• the "voie verte", which starts in $$$ and finishes in $$$. It should go to Lyon one day (some parts are already done) This one you really have to cycle. It was on old railway line so it is very flat. It is sealed, large and very well organized. You can find water and picnic areas all the way. You can camp in Taize for free (it is a youth christian camp with mass three times a day which you do not have to attend, although the atmosphere and the singing are worth trying. People go there from all over the world and the songs and prayers are in various languages)<br>• The French riviera cycling path starts in Toulon and finishes in Saint Raphael. It is nice to have a cycling path in this busy area, but it is not finished at all. Small bits are done one after another, and at a slow pace. But it is sealed, a little hilly, and you go through nice places such as the Esterel, which is the wildest area you can find on this coastline.<br>- campsites<br>Camping places in Europe are never free. Sometimes, it is owned by the town ("camping municipal"), so that the fee is not expensive. For 2 people with a tent, it can cost from 10 euros to 30 euros for one night. In Italy, the camping areas are even more expensive sometimes, and the showers are not always included. You are not allowed to camp anywhere you want, and it is often hard to find an isolated place. The best way is probably to ask people if you can put your tent in their garden or field. That way you often meet nice people, but some people say no.<br><br>The Munda Biddi Mountainbike trail<br><br>This cycling trail starts in Mundaring (near Perth) and should finish in Albany one day. The first section from Mundaring to Collie was done about 10 years ago. But the second section from Collie to Nannup is not officially opened yet, although it is finished. The maps of this section can be obtained only from the department of Nature and Conservation. If you send them the money, they will send you the map (Sheffone of the Dwelling Up tourist information center got it for us. Thank you very much once again). You can find the maps of the first section in many places (bike shops and bookshops in Perth, information desk in Mundaring, Jarrahdale, Dwelling Up, Collie, Nannup).<br><br>The maps are very useful, since some of the direction signs are missing. For us, we also realized after our first day on the Munda Biddi that some parts were too bumpy for recumbents. It was generally the parts written as "challenging" on the maps. So we decided to do the "easy" and "medium" parts on the trail and just skipped the "challenging" ones by taking the roads following the trail.<br><br>With a mountainbike, it seems this trail should not be very hard. The sun could be the hardest thing (try to avoid the summer). There are a few uphills, but 10 days from Mundaring to Nannup should leave you enough time to admire the Nature you come across.<br><br>The campsites are really great. Apparently, they were built by convicts. They can host from 10 to 20 people, although we always were alone. There is  a main shelter with two picnic tables outside. The main shelter where you can sleep is open, so bring a warm sleeping bad (it can be very cold outside, even in the summer) and maybe a head mosquito net, although we used only repellent. There are always two rainwatertanks, and a bush toilet.<br>You are not supposed to make a fire, but we did, because there really was no risk, and it was cold in the evening, and we were damp ourselves.<br><br>You can buy some food in many places (jarrahdale, collie, boyanup, nannup), so you shouldn't need to have more than three days of food with you. Of course you always have to take lots of water. You cannot drink the water from the tanks right away, so we used a gravity filter during the night and had the freshwater in the morning. You can also use the pills, but we prefer avoiding drinking too much of these chemicals.<br><br>The scenery is very nice on this trail. You spend most of your time in the forest of Jarrah and Karri trees. Wild animals go across the trail all the time (kangaroos, wallabies, bobtails, rabbits, wonderful birds...) You meet very few people and cars. Just do it !</div>

<div class="content">Parlons matériel...<br><br>Après 4 mois d'utilisation intensive, 4000 km et beaucoup de transports, voilà ce que nous pensons pour l'instant de notre matériel :<br><br><span class="imgright"><img alt="" src="../../../../files.myopera.com/f6-ln/albums/570575/thumbs/c%27%20est%20parti%21.jpg_thumb.jpg"></span>- les vélos : 2 vélos couchés Pioneer de la firme hollandaise Nazca. Un excellent achat ! Nous ne les avons jamais regrettés, même dans les côtes. On est tellement bien dessus que quand nous avons un peu de temps et que notre tente est posée, nous repartons souvent a vide en promenade. Le dossier est très confortable, nous n'avons eu aucun problème physique (mal au dos, ...) Nous n'avons eu des petites douleurs aux genoux que les jours ou nous avions un peu force et ne nous étions pas bien etires. On voit bien le paysage, on est détendu, on peut mettre 4 sacoches facilement et beaucoup de poids (eau en particulier) assez bas, ce qui évite de déstabiliser le vélo. En plus ce sont des vélos couches plutôt pas trop chers : environ 1500 euros.<br><br>Merci encore a Jean-Jacques Duprat pour ses bons conseils.<br><br><span class="imgright"><img alt="" src="../../../../files.myopera.com/f6-ln/albums/570575/thumbs/P7190009.jpg_thumb.jpg"></span>  - les guidons : j'ai choisi un guidon haut et j'en suis très contente, il est robuste, facile a régler, l'angle pour tourner est un peu supérieur a celui d'un guidon bas je pense, ce qui facilite les choses en ville. Le vélo est très facile a maneuvrer quand il faut le pousser, et on tombe moins, surtout au début, car le bras de levier pour retenir le vélo est plus grand.<br><br><span class="imgleft"><img alt="" src="../../../../files.myopera.com/f6-ln/albums/570575/thumbs/P1020343.jpg_thumb.jpg"></span><br>Francis a choisi un guidon bas, privilégiant la decontraction et l'esthétique. Ça lui a valu pas mal de petites chutes et de bleus sur les cuisses au début, mais je crois qu'il ne regrette pas son "avion de chasse". La transmission à la roue avant se fait par une petite biélette, très jolie, mais un peu fragile je pense.<br>Il faut essayer les deux pour faire son choix.<br><br>- les pneus : des Schwalbe Marathon. Géniaux ! Aucun problème depuis le début.  Ils s'usent très lentement malgré les pistes, les branches, les cailloux... Apparemment, pour un long voyage, il est préférable de ne pas choisir des Schwalbe Marathon Racer car ils tiennent moins bien dans la boue et sur route mouillée (conseil vecolo). En revanche, ils ne sont pas faciles a trouver, et nous avons du demander a Jean-Jacques de nous en envoyer un pour en avoir un de rechange. Le seul hic : avec le poids, les chambres a air doivent être gonflées a 4,5 voire 5 bars, ce qui est impossible a obtenir avec une pompe a main. Et les rustines ne tiennent pas très longtemps a haute pression. Donc si on veut gonfler bien, il faut changer la chambre et avoir soit une pompe a pied (mais c'est lourd), soit un compresseur (dans les stations services, mais elles ne montent pas toujours au delà de 3,5 bars. Dans ce dernier cas, il faut également un petit adaptateur car les valves de nos roues sont fines et les embouts des compresseurs sont généralement larges. Nous gardons notre adaptateur précieusement !<br><br>- les axes de roues antivol : achetés chez Decathlon, ils nous simplifient la vie. Nos antivols sont de petits U (pour moins de poids), et il n'est donc pas souvent possible d'attacher le velo par le cadre. Avec les roues antivol, on peut attacher le vélo a la roue sans risque (même a Naples !!!) Nous gardons les clefs précieusement aussi.<br><br>- tout le reste de l'équipement du vélo est de marque Shimano (V-brakes, dérailleur Alivio...). Nous avons laisse Jean-Jacques choisir, et ne le regrettons pas. Nous avons du réajuster les dérailleurs, mais c'est normal avec l'usage.<br><br>- les sacoches Ortlieb : un peu chères mais tellement parfaites ! Très étanches, résistantes, faciles a clipper et declipper. Le seul hic : chaque sacoche pèse 1,1 kg, donc la charge monte vite !<br><br><span class="imgright"><img alt="" src="../../../../files.myopera.com/f6-ln/albums/589655/thumbs/P1020453.jpg_thumb.jpg"></span>- la tente : Spear 2 GT de Mountain Hardwear. Les vendeurs du Vieux Campeur nous ont conseillé cette tente a 300 euros alors que nous voulions en acheter une a 600, plus légère, mais selon eux beaucoup plus fragile.<br><br>Nous en etions a moitie contents :<br>- Elle est en effet tres pratique a monter, spacieuse et tres tres costaud.<br>MAIS : Elle n'est pas tres impermeable. Le tapis de sol se mouille lorsque le sol est mouille, et ca passe dans la tente. Quant au revetement exterieur, s'il pleut tres fort, l'eau passe un peu a travers, ca "brumise" a l'interieur.<br><br>Nous sommes donc alles voir les gens de Mountain Hardwear a Christchurch et ils nous ont change la tente sans faire d'histoires. Ils etaient etonnants de gentillesse. Nous avons donc un nouveau modele de chez Mountain Hardwear, plus leger mais sans la grande abside : la SKYLEDGE 3.<br><br>Nous vous dirons ce qu'on en pense.<br> <br><br>- les matelas "autogonflants" Thermarest : très biens. Même quand il fait froid, que le tapis de sol est un peu humide et que le sol est caillouteux et valonné, nous dormons comme des loirs. Apparemment, il ne faut surtout pas les mettre en plein soleil. Donc nous ne le faisons pas, nous les degonflons même pendant la journée quand il fait très chaud, et tout va bien.<br><br><span class="imgcenter"><img alt="" src="../../../../files.myopera.com/f6-ln/albums/576240/thumbs/P1020364.jpg_thumb.jpg"></span><br><br>- les sacs de couchage Swing 500 (pour Francis l'homme fort) et 700 (pour moi qui suis un peu frileuse) : très biens. Ils sèchent assez vite quand ils ont pris un peu d'humidité. La colerette anti-froid fonctionne très bien. Et comme ils sont en plume, ils sont assez légers.<br><br><span class="imgright"><img alt="" src="../../../../files.myopera.com/f6-ln/albums/576240/thumbs/P1020370.jpg_thumb.jpg"></span> - le SPOT (système de geolocalisation satellite émetteur) : nous en sommes ravis. Nous n'avons jamais eu a l'utiliser pour appeler de l'aide, et on croise les doigts pour que ça dure. Mais il nous rassure quand nous sommes dans des endroits isolés, et rassure nos proches, qui peuvent suivre notre position presque en direct en mode Track. Nous envoyons également chaque soir un message ok, pour dire que tout va bien, et nos proches reçoivent soit un mail, soit un sms disant que "tout baigne" avec nos coordonnées GPS. Le boîtier coûte 200 euros et un an d'abonnement coûte 100 euros, l'assurance en cas de recherche pas hélicoptère coûte 11 euros a l'année. Ça fait beaucoup moins cher qu'un téléphone satellite ou qu'une balise de détresse, et ça nous est beaucoup plus utile pour l'instant puisque nous l'utilisons tous les jours. Il résiste bien a l'eau et aux chocs (on a testé <img src="../../../../static.myopera.com/community/graphics/smiley.gif" class="smiley s-smile" alt="smile"> ).<br><br><span class="imgright"><img alt="" src="../../../../files.myopera.com/f6-ln/albums/576240/thumbs/P1020371.jpg_thumb.jpg"></span> - le GPS : marque Garmin, modèle Vista. Nous l'utilsons très souvent. Au début, nous le laissions allumé toute la journée, et nous avions donc tous nos profils d'altitude et nos trajets. Mais ce petit objet est très gourmand en énergie, du coup nous ne l'allumons maintenant que ponctuellement. Mais nous sommes heureux de l'avoir. En général, c'est quand tout va mal qu'il nous est utile ! Encore merci a mon frere Jean-Baptiste d'avoir relecharge toutes les cartes sur internet et de nous les avoirs mises sur la carte micro SD.<br><br>- le iPod Touch : excellent gadget. Francis ne l'utilisait guère a Londres et lui preferait son ordinateur portable. Mais il nous sert maintenant beaucoup : léger, il nous permet d'écouter de la musique, d'écrire les textes que nous mettons sur le blog, et d'accéder a internet quand il y a le WiFi.<br><br><span class="imgright"><img alt="" src="../../../../files.myopera.com/f6-ln/albums/576240/thumbs/P1020377.jpg_thumb.jpg"></span> - la guitare Martin's Backpacker : elle résiste pour l'instant aux attaques (a mes chutes, aux intempéries), le son est agréable même s'il n'est pas très fort. Et Francis progresse bien, même s'il n'a pas toujours le courage de s'y mettre après une grosse journée.<br><br><span class="imgright"><img alt="" src="../../../../files.myopera.com/f6-ln/albums/576240/thumbs/P1020367.jpg_thumb.jpg"></span> - le réchaud Omnifuel MSR : tres bien. Nous avons commence par utiliser du gaz par habitude, puis nous sommes mis a l'essence sans plomb dès l'Italie, car les recharges de gaz étaient trop chères. Depuis, nous cuisinons essentiellement au sans plomb. De temps en temps, nous utilisons un peu de gaz pour décrasser le réchaud (nous essayons d'avoir toujours un peu de gaz en secours), car c'est le problème de l'essence, ça met de la suie partout. Ça rend la vaisselle plus difficile, mais c'est tellement moins cher et tellement facile a trouver. Ça amuse aussi les pompistes qui se demandent pourquoi notre facture est si faible et nous voient arriver avec notre petite bouteille de 500 mL (surtout en Australie !). L'essence dure un peu moins longtemps que le gaz.<br>Apres 6 mois d'utilisation intensive, le tuyau s'est perce. Nous avons contacte les revendeurs de Primus en Nouvelle-Zelande. Ce fut un peu laborieux, mais une fois arrives a Christchurch, la boutique R&amp;R Sport nous a change le tuyau sans probleme.<br><br>- les petits tabourets, les gamelles en alu antiadhesives : top</div>

<p class="postdate"><a href="../../blog/show.dml/2806717.html" title="Permanent link">Thursday, December 11, 2008 11:00:19 AM</a></p>
<div class="content">La Grece et notre départ d'Europe<br><br>Lors de notre dernier récit, nous quittions l'Italie a bord du navire Agoudimos en direction de la Grèce. Et puis hop, silence radio pendant 20 jours et on annonce comme des fleurs qu'on est bien arrivé en Australie, qu'il fait beau et qu'on voit des kangourous. Belle ellipse.<br><br><span class="imgright"><img alt="" src="../../../../files.myopera.com/f6-ln/albums/635312/thumbs/P1040255.jpg_thumb.jpg"></span><br>Alors voila ce qui s'est passé. 5h du mat, arrivée a Patras.. L'avant du bateau s'ouvre doucement, nous jaillissons. En sortant du port, nous croisons une bande de jeunes qui courent en sens inverse un peu courbés. On ne comprend pas. Et puis autour du port on remarque des dizaines puis des centaines de gens par petit groupes de 5/10 qui ont l'air d'attendre quelque chose. Hélène va faire quelques courses pendant que je surveille les affaires, et 2 d'entre eux viennent me voir, intrigués par nos vélos. Ils parlent bien anglais, alors je leur demande ce qu'ils font la. Reponse decontractée :<br><br>"Nous ? Bien, on est Afghans et vu qu'il y a rien a faire dans notre pays, on va à Londres."<br>"Et vous faites comment sans papiers ?"<br>(petit haussement d'épaules)"A pieds, en passant par l'Afganistan, le Turkmenistan, la Turquie, la Grece. Tout ca c'est facile, y'a pas de controles. Après ici c'est difficile, faut réussir a monter sur un ferry vers l'Italie. Mais c'est possible. Après on remonte de Bari a Calais, ca c'est facile. Et après c'est difficile, faut prendre un bateau pour l'Angleterre."<br><br>Et ça faisait déjà un an qu'ils étaient partis. Dire qu'on était fier d'atteindre Athenes a velo...<br><br><span class="imgleft"><img alt="" src="../../../../files.myopera.com/f6-ln/albums/635312/thumbs/P1040253.jpg_thumb.jpg"></span> <br>Après nous avons foncé tête baissés, pour rejoindre les parents d'hélène a Athenes a temps. Patras - Athenes 220 km de côte assez jolie, nous nous baignons chaque midi après avoir mangé notre barquette de Tarama et de tzatziki. Beau temps, peu de circulation, ce qui tombe bien vu le style de conduite du pays... Pas mal de detritus sur le bord des routes, un peu comme vers Naples. Dommage vu la beauté du paysage ! <br><br><span class="imgright"><img alt="" src="../../../../files.myopera.com/f6-ln/albums/635312/thumbs/P1040249.jpg_thumb.jpg"></span> <br>Nous traversons le canal de Korinthe et rejoignons Athenes en 4 jours, l'étape Grecque aura été de courue durée. A athènes nous vivons comme des rois : hôtel, restaurant, visites culturelles, les parents d'hélène nous ont même apporté des habits "normaux"... <br><br><span class="imgleft"><img alt="" src="../../../../files.myopera.com/f6-ln/albums/635312/thumbs/P1040248.jpg_thumb.jpg"></span> <br>Le rêve ! Tout ceci facilite grandement notre mission principale : organiser la suite du voyage. Partis de Paris avec seulement une vague idée de ce que nous ferions par la suite, nous sommes au pied du mur. Le plan était d'aller pédaler en Asie.<br><br>Premier écueil, Quatar Airways propose un Athene - Bangkok a 370€. Pas très cher, cool. Mais avec 20 kg de bagages max, or nous en avons près de 40 chacun. Le kg de trop coûte 43€. Ça c'est de l'écueil !<br><br>Deuxième ecueil, il faut souvent avoir le billet de sortie pour rentrer dans un pays, et en velo on est jamais sur du temps qu on va mettre pour aller d'un endroit a l'autre. Du coup les billets non flexibles nous font un peu peur.<br><br>Troisième écueil, un puissant groupe de lobbying se met en place du côté de la famille Fron pour nous dissuader d'aller en Asie. Nous n'en reviendrons pas vivant, ils mangent les touristes et égorgent les vélos. En plus la saison des pluies n'est pas tout a fait finie et en velo ce détail n'en est pas un...<br><br>Une seule solution pour sauver notre budget et etre tranquilles sur les dates : le billet tour du monde !<br>Heureusement nous nous étions un peu renseignés la dessus a Paris, et nous savions que parmis les 3 alliances de compagnies qui proposent ces formules, Oneworld est la plus adaptée. Seul petit problème, si les dates sont flexibles, le trajet lui ne l'est pas. Tout changement est payant. Il nous a donc fallu determiner toute la suite de notre itineraire en 2 jours. <br><br>Branchés jusqu'à 4 heure du matin sur internet, nous recherchons les meilleurs itinéraires a faire en velo. Nous trouvons tout et n'importe quoi et sommes vite perdus : comme ficeler tout ca en aussi peu de temps ? Et là, tentant un geste désespéré,  je tappe "plus belles pistes cyclables du monde" dans Google et oh MIRACLE, les petits souliers sont juste à mon pieds ! Je tombe sur un site qui décrit ce qui est considéré comme les 10 plus belles routes à faire en velo. La solution clef en main. Nous choisissons donc celles qui nous semble les plus sexy et nous obtenons notre programme :<br><br>Munda Biddi en Australie<br>Carretera Australe au Chili<br>Railway road aux States<br>Route verte au Quebec<br><br>Nous gardons tout de même 2 bouts du plan initial : Melbourne - Sydney par la côte et la Nouvelle Zelande . Envoyez c'est pesé !<br><br>Avec notre billet nous bénéficions du "piece system", ce qui veut dire 2*23kg de bagages chacun, adieu les excédents faramineux.<br><br>Pour ceux que le billet tour du monde intéresse, en gros le système est le suivant :<br>Vous devez faire le tour du monde donc revenir au point de départ.<br>Toujours tourner dans le même sens sauf au sein des continents<br>Vous avez le droit a 16 segments. Chaque fois que vous mettez les pieds dans un aéroport compte pour un segment. Donc un vol avec 1 escale compte pour 2 segments. Si vous voyagez par vos propres moyen entre 2 villes, cela utilise un segment quand même.<br>Vous payez un forfait en fonction du nombre de continents visités. Ils ont aussi une formule ou l'on paye en fonction du nombre de miles parcourus mais le vendeur vous dit ce qui est le plus avantageux, donc on s'en occupe pas .<br>Et aussi mille autres règles tordues qu'on ne listera pas...<br><br><br><span class="imgright"><img alt="" src="../../../../files.myopera.com/f6-ln/albums/580514/thumbs/P1040685.jpg_thumb.jpg"></span><br>Nos billets en poche, nous allons gaiement acheter du papier bulle, et un rouleau de scotch. Nous nous procurons 2 grands cartons et nous prenons le train vers l'aeroport. Prudents comme nous sommes, nous arrivons trèeès en avance, 2h30 avant le départ. Et nous commençons joyeusement a démonter les vélos, à les encartonner avec amour, à dévisser les pédales... <br><br><span class="imgleft"><img alt="" src="../../../../files.myopera.com/f6-ln/albums/580514/thumbs/P1040686.jpg_thumb.jpg"></span><br>Sauf que tout ça prend beaucoup plus temps que prévu et plus le temps passe plus la pression monte : nous sommes completement à la bourre. Nous n'avons pas assez de scotch, il faut courir partout pour en acheter, le plastique pour les sacoches n' est pas adapté. En énorme stress nous enregistrons les bagages 15 minutes avant le départ de l'avion en nous faisant enguirlander. Le mec nous dit que nos embalages ne tiennent pas la route et que nos vélos ne vont jamais arriver entiers. Il attrape un des sacs qui contient nos sacoches et le déchire à moitié en le mettant sur le tapis roulant. Ça tombe bien, nos sacoches ne sont pas attachées entre elles et il n'y a pas nos noms dessus... Nous montons tous transpirant dans l'avion et voyons arriver nos bagages par le hublot. Nos vélos sont toujours emballés. Le bagagiste attrape le sac qui ne ressemble déjà plus à grand chose et secoue la tete, "c'est quoi ce travail ?". Avec 2 escales dont une de presque 24 heures a hong kong nous craignons le pire.<br><br>Arrivés dans le petit aéroport de Amman en Jordanie, nous voyons notre dernière chance de salut : mettre la main sur nos bagages et rescotcher le tout. Nous supplions le personnel de Royal Jordanian qui finit par céder. Un petit monsieur trapu prend la reference de nos bagages et repart. 5 minutes plus tard, un tapis roulant se met en marche rien que pour nous (un tapis volant aurait été fait plus local mais bon...) et nos bagages arrivent. Joie,  tout le monde est encore là. Nous ré-emballons tout avec conviction, version momification égyptienne, nous ecrivons nos noms partout et nous rendons le tout au bagagiste, rassurés. Il a bien mérité son bakshish.<br><br><br>La suite du voyage se passe bien. Royal Jordanian nous fournit une chambre d'hôtel pour les quelques heures que dure notre escale, la classe. Nous repartons le lendemain vers Hong-Kong via Bangkok pour l'escale la plus efficace du monde. Nous arrivons samedi à 19h et repartons le lendemain à 16h. Par chance nos bagages restent dans les entrailles de l'aéroport et nous n'avons pas à nous en soucier. <br><br><br><span class="imgright"><img alt="" src="../../../../files.myopera.com/f6-ln/albums/645201/thumbs/P1040691.jpg_thumb.jpg"></span> <br>Sur place nous attend le formidable Seb, l'homme qui fonctionne sur pile nucléaire. Nous le rejoignons chez lui et partons direct dîner. Notre 5eme repas en 24h puisque nous avons mangé dans tous les avions et à l'hôtel en Jordanie. Puis c'est Hong-Kong by night et la visite de quelques bars du coin. Le décalage joue en notre faveur puisque pour nous il est environ 6 heures plus tôt. Seb lui est en vitesse de croisière. 4h du mat dodo. 3h30 plus tard, lever, il est temps de faire Hong-Kong by day. Au reveil, Hélène d'habitude si vaillante a la tête dans le ... dans l'oreiller. Pour une fois c'est moi qui doit la tirer du lit. <br><br><span class="imgleft"><img alt="" src="../../../../files.myopera.com/f6-ln/albums/645201/thumbs/P1040695.jpg_thumb.jpg"></span> <br>Nous visitons le Peak, nous balladons à droite à gauche. Hong-Kong nous paraît étonnement séduisante, pleine de contrastes. Végétation luxuriante et buildings se côtoient, les petits marchés où l'on vend plein de trucs bizarres sont au pieds des grattes-ciels. On a l'air de pouvoir s'echapper très vite de la ville et la nature environnante à l'air sympathique. Dire qu'il y a exactement un an Helene et moi pensions venir travailler ici...Le destin en a voulu grandement autrement. Mais il n'y a toujours pas de dentiste français a HK, qui sait si nous ne reviendrons pas ?<br><br>L'heure de notre vol arrive, nous quittons notre ami cyborg (Encore merci si tu nouq lis !) qui se sent en pleine forme d'avoir été si sage pour un samedi soir et nous nous envolons vers Perth.<br><br><br><span class="imgright"><img alt="" src="../../../../files.myopera.com/f6-ln/albums/580514/thumbs/P1040707.jpg_thumb.jpg"></span>Nous avons le plaisir de retrouver nos deux vélos (Albatros et K-fée ndlr) sains et saufs dans leurs cartons tout dechirés. Un frein de tordu, rien de bien méchant. La douane australienne voit d'un oeil mefiant arriver nos vélos, il faut le reconnaitre un peu sales. Il reste de la terre "européenne" dessus. Or en Australie on ne plaisante pas avec les risques de contamination. Les colons en arrivant ont refilé toutes les maladies du monde aux indigènes, ils ne veulent pas qu'on leur fasse la même chose. Ok, ok, je suis mauvaise langue. Du coup nos montures passent en décontamination où ils sont brossés et lavés. Ils en ressortent rutilants. <br><br>Il est 1h du matin heure locale, du coup nous dormons dans l'aeroport. Vers 6h nous sortons la trousse à outils et nous remontons les vélos. Le soleil brille, des hommes aux chapeaux de Crocodile Dundee déambulent dans le hall,   des oiseaux poussent des cris étranges dans les arbres, les pédales nous démangent, nous sommes en Australie !</div>

<div class="content">Australie : le Sud Ouest (1ers jours)<br><br>24/11/2008 Au coin du feu et enfin au sec, hullo !<br><br>Cela fait maintenant 7 jours que nous sommes en Australie et 5 jours que nous suivons la Munda biddi mountainbike trail.<br><br><span class="imgleft"><img alt="" src="../../../../files.myopera.com/f6-ln/albums/645182/thumbs/P1040709.jpg_thumb.jpg"></span><br>A Perth nous avons essentiellement préparé notre voyage a travers le Bush. Trouver un demonte-cassette, une pince légère et de diamètre ajustable, des kits piqûres de serpents..., ce n'est pas mince affaire. Nous decouvrons tout de même un peu la ville au passage, très américaine mais aussi très agréable avec ses grands espaces verts autour de la Swan River et ses pistes cyclables. Au camping on nous a dit de prendre garde des animaux sauvages : serpents mortels, araignées anthropophages et autres charmantes bestioles. Disciplinés, nous avons lu moultes documentations sur ces grosses bestioles. J'ai aussi appris qu'il fallait se méfier des petites : j'ai subi le 1er jour une attaque de fourmis, qui m'ont fait en quelques minutes des dizaines de piqures qui me demangeaient atrocement. Il paraît qu'il faut mettre du vinaigre et que les grosses fourmis, c'est encore pire. Ça m'a gratté pendant 4 jours.<br><br><span style="color: skyblue">Leçon n*1 : d'abord se méfier des petites bestioles.</span><br><br><span class="imgright"><img alt="" src="../../../../files.myopera.com/f6-ln/albums/645182/thumbs/P1040710.jpg_thumb.jpg"></span> On apprend au passage que les flics australiens ne sont pas "cool" comme nous le pensions. Je me suis fait arretee pour faufilage intempestif avant un feu rouge ! Ledit policier m'a demande de m'imaginer a quel point je pourrais avoir mal si je me faisais renverser voire traîner par une voiture. Comment ma peau allait être dechiquetée... Il faut avoir des protections en kevlar pour se faufiler entre des voitures ! A tous les cyclistes parisiens, salve.<br><br><span style="color: skyblue">Donc, leçon n*2, on ne plaisante pas avec les flics australiens (heureusement que j'avais mon casque).</span><br><br>Autre anecdote. Dans le train, Francis rencontre Franck, qui lui explique en buvant Bacardi Breazer sur Bacardi Breazer que maintenant, tout est trop compliqué. Quand il était jeune, il allait dans le Bush, et se prenait des ecsta ou des lignes de coke sur les troncs d'arbres, qu'ils ramassaient des champignons hallucinogènes au pied des pins et que ça, c'était cool !<br><br><span class="imgleft"><img alt="" src="../../../../files.myopera.com/f6-ln/albums/645182/thumbs/P1040713.jpg_thumb.jpg"></span> Puis nous sommes partis vers l'aventure. Arrivés a Mundaring (départ de la Munda Biddi), nous decouvrons que la piste a l'air tout a fait carrossable. Nous sommes rassurés car le dépliant sur la Munda Biddi dit qu'il n'est pas possible de passer en velo couche. Un polonais ancien apiculteur nous dit également qu'il a fait du camping sauvage dans le Bush pendant vingt ans, et que même si c'est interdit, c'est top et il n'y a pas de risques.<br><br><span style="color: skyblue">Leçon n*3 : Dans le Bush, on fait ce qu'on veut.</span><br><br>Première journée, premières galères. En fait, il est des passages sur cette piste pour VTT qui ne sont faisables qu'en VTT. Tiens donc ? On galère, on pousse nos vélos dans des montées pleines de cailloux, on se fait "carwasher" en passant dans un chemin trop étroit pour nous avec des buissons trempés, etc. Francis voit des kangourous (soit disant !) 2 fois, mais ils sont partis quand j'arrive. Ça m'énerve alors je passe devant, mais rien.<br>On arrive enfin au "campsite" après seulement 39 km parcourus.<br><br><span style="color: skyblue">Leçon n*4 : les pistes cyclables pour VTT sont faites pour les VTT</span>, mais :<br><br><span style="color: skyblue">Leçon n*5 : les parties de la Munda Bidi notées "facile" sur les cartes semblent faisables par nous autres vélos-couches.<br><br>Leçon n*6 : les "campsites" sont géniaux.  </span><br><br><span class="imgright"><img alt="" src="../../../../files.myopera.com/f6-ln/albums/645182/thumbs/P1040718.jpg_thumb.jpg"></span> Gratuits, avec un abri principal comportant un endroit pour mettre les vélos, un dortoir (ouvert sur l'extérieur, il faut un bon sac de couchage), et des tables de pique-nique, ainsi qu'un petit abris toilettes. L'eau de pluie tombant sur le toit de l'abris principal est recupéré dans 2 grands conteneurs. Officiellement, on n'a pas le droit de faire du feu, mais il semble que tout le monde en fait, et ça réchauffe !<br><br>Forts de cette expérience, nous avons décidé de suivre les parties faciles de la Munda Bidi et de les rejoindre par la route, mais :<br><br><span style="color: skyblue">Leçon n*7 : les routes australiennes ("road") sont le plus souvent des pistes. Les "highways", elles, sont asphaltées.</span><br><br><span class="imgleft"><img alt="" src="../../../../files.myopera.com/f6-ln/albums/597921/thumbs/P1040725.jpg_thumb.jpg"></span> <br>Ça va moins vite, ça derape pas mal, mais il n'y a pas trop de passage et on est plus près de la nature. Nous faisons en effet dès ce deuxième jour la connaissance des kangourous, d'un gros lézard (un bobtail pour les intimes), d'oiseaux divers et variés (perruches, cuckaroo...), de magnifiques papillons oranges...<br>Et enfin de quelques 4x4 rutilantes qui passent a toute berzingue en tentant de faire des "burnout" dès qu'il y a un petit segment asphalté. Les chauffards semblent souvent avoir au plus 16-17 ans.<br>Nous dormons a nouveau dans un super refuge. Il a plus un peu dans la journée et nous espérons que ça ira mieux demain.<br><br><span class="imgright"><img alt="" src="../../../../files.myopera.com/f6-ln/albums/645182/thumbs/P1050408.jpg_thumb.jpg"></span><br>Le 3e et le 4e jour, nous pedalons dans la forêt sur des pistes ou sur la "Munda", nous montons, nous descendons, nous montons, et j'en passe. Nous mangeons du thon ou du saumon a midi, et des pates a la sauce tomate le soir. Nous voyons divers animaux (un emeu entre autres, que Francis avait pris pour un terrible kasoar, grosse autruche qui peut eventrer un homme si elle se sent agressee. Je me sentais mal à l'aise apres sur le chemin, bizzarement !) le paysage change assez vite, les forêts dégagent ici des parfums intenses (que francis a comparé a l'odeur d'un désodorisant pour toilettes, mais détrompez vous, ça sent vraiment bon.) Il pleut régulièrement, ce qui complique un peu tout. Nous pensons faire un procès au Lonely Planet qui ventait la douceur du climat de Perth.<br><br><span style="color: skyblue"><br>Leçon n*8 : il ne fait pas toujours beau et chaud au printemps dans le Sud Ouest australien.</span><br><br><span class="imgright"><img alt="" src="../../../../files.myopera.com/f6-ln/albums/645182/thumbs/P1040733.jpg_thumb.jpg"></span><br>Notons également que j'ai fait hier ma première chute et que je ne l'ai pas ratée.  Dans une descente, un peu au dessus de 35km/h, je me suis pris un amas de cailloux et me suis retrouvée emberlificotée dans mon velo couchée. Quelques eraflures sur le guidon, les paumes, les genoux et les avant-bras, un beau bleu sur la cuisse et un pantalon irrécupérable. Rien de très grave finalement. Mais :<br><br><span style="color: skyblue">Leçon n*9 : il ne faut pas dépasser les 35km/h sur les pistes.</span><br><br>Heureusement le soir, nous avons installé la tente et sommes partis faire une petite rando jusqu'aux Mandalup Falls. Une petite baignade avec le coucher de soleil, puis une soirée au coin du feu, et mes egratignures sont oubliées.<br><br>Aujourd'hui nous avons plié la tente sous la pluie pour rejoindre Dwelling Up, petit village avec un "general store", un commissariat, une poste, un hôtel qui sent la vinasse, et un magnifique centre d'informations touristiques. Nous cherchions la carte de la nouvelle portion de la Munda, qui va de Collie à Nannup, mais celle ci est très difficile a obtenir pour l'instant, du fait que ce segment n'est pas encore ouvert actuellement. La dame, adorable, a promis de nous l'obtenir et de nous la faire envoyer à Collie.<br><br>Aux toilettes, j'ai alors rencontre une araignée adorable.<br><br><span class="imgcenter"><img alt="" src="../../../../files.myopera.com/f6-ln/albums/597921/thumbs/P1040736.jpg_thumb.jpg"></span><br><br>Ensuite, nous avons alterné pédalage sous la pluie, "abritage" sous des arbres pour averse torrentielle, passage de walabis et de kangourous, Safari photo de Francis en tee-shirt sous la pluie pour tenter d'immortaliser des kangourous. Mais ceux-ci bondissent vite !<br>Pour finalement arriver a nouveau dans un campsite, celui de Bidjar Ngoulin. Pendant que Francis tentait d'allumer un feu avec du bois trempe pour nous réchauffer, j'ai tout mis a sécher et fait a manger. Un rumpsteak mémorable, avec une purée "butternut"-carotte, des fettucine au parmesan et une bouteille de vin local. Après une telle journée, c'est le "kiff" intégral.<br><br><span class="imgleft"><img alt="" src="../../../../files.myopera.com/f6-ln/albums/597921/thumbs/P1040738.jpg_thumb.jpg"></span> J'ai écrasé en fin de repas une grosse fourmi, a priori une bull ant, de 2 cm (Francis trouve que j'exagère, mais elle était vraiment grosse), de peur de me faire piquer par elle. Je n'ose pas même imaginer a quel point ça doit faire mal. Mais nous avons du vinaigre.<br><br>Je finis d'écrire à la chaleur du feu que je vais malheureusement devoir quitter pour aller me coucher.<br><br><span style="color: skyblue">Leçon n*10 : toutes les bonnes choses ont une fin.</span>
